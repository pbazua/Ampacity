        "\n",
        "This lab focuses on optimizing AI generated code using few-shot prompt techniques with the IBM Granite Code model on Google Colab to optimize code generation quality. Few-shot prompting allows the model to draw from multiple examples, enabling more accurate and nuanced outputs compared to the initial zero-shot prompt approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab builds on Lab 1, which focused on generating code using Granite Code models, by shifting the focus to refining the model output through few-shot prompting techniques. The exercise focuses on optimizing UI components to create a more intuitive interface for an online bookstore, demonstrating how incorporating examples can enhance the quality and precision of the generated code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you’ll use the IBM Granite Code model family hosted on Replicate to optimize Python code that enhances the design of the landing page for an online bookstore.\n",

        "To complete this lab, you must have access to an account with Replicate to make model inference calls. You must also obtain the API token from your Replicate account, which will be securely added as a Google Colab secret. Familiarity with Python is not necessary but can be helpful for understanding the generated code.\n",
